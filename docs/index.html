    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The theme of this project was learning to smooth things out, starting from drawing smooth curves, to smooth shading, to subdivision to make smoother meshes. In the first half, the approach taken was largely that of interpolation. In the last part, we used approximation formulas to make a tighter shape that maintains the same topology as the original one.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


    <b>
      Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
    </b>
    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm lets us create a bezier curve from a series of control points by iterating through a
      series of points and linearly interpolating between the subsequent points to generate a new list of points. This
      is done until only one point is left, and this gives us the Bezier curve defined by the original given set of
      points. We implemented it by simply iterating through the given points, linearly interpolating subsequent points,
      and returning the result, which performs one iterative step of the algorithm.
    </p>
    <br>


    <b>
      Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing.
      Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.
    </b>

    <b>
      Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to
      evaluate Bezier surfaces.
    </b>
    <p>
      It extends to bezier surfaces because we can interpolate along multiple curves along the surface. Once we do that, we can simply interpolate among the resulting points from the previous step. We implemented it by writing an evaluate_step function that is similar to how it was implemented in task 1, then having an evaluate_1D function that handles the recursion (calls evaluate_step until we're left with one point). We then had an evaluate function that does what I described above, which includes calling evaluate_1D on all the curves with the initial parameter u, and then doing the same with the resulting points, but this time with parameter v.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
    </b>
    <p>
      We implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by first iterating through all the neighboring vertices. At each
      vertex, we accessed the position vectors and calculated the cross product, which gives the area-weighted vertex
      normal vector. We added this vector to the running total, and continued doing this for all neighboring vertices.
      At the end, we normalized the resulting summation vector.

    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation /
      debugging tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>
      We implemented the edge flip by assigning labels to each edge, vertex, half edge and face and then tracking what happens to them after the flip. We individually assigned each of these elements to the correct new value, as opposed to writing generic code that works in a loop. We used the trick of setting redundant values as opposed to only the ones that have changed in order to avoid mistakes.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation /
      debugging tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>
      We implemented the edge split operation by tracking what new edges, vertices, faces, and half edges would be
      created as a result, and then making sure that the pointers for all mesh elements point to another appropriate
      mesh element without breaking the mesh structure. The only implementation trick we used was creating new elements
      first and making sure to set the attributes of the new half-edges first because a couple of them have twins that
      are defined by the previously defined 6 original half edges, so if we were to set the first original 6's
      attributes first, we'd lose that information.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging
      tricks you have used.
    </b>
    <p>
      We first recomputed the positions of all of the old vertices and new vertices by taking weighted averages of their neighbors. Then, we followed the suggested approach of splitting all the edges and flipping new edges that connected new and old vertices to subdivide each triangle into four triangles. Finally, we assigned the new positions that we precomputed in the first step. Parts of implementation that were tricky were 1) recognizing that computing the positions before changing the mesh made things much easier and 2) avoiding edges that weren't actually new could be done by checking that there is at least one new vertex involved in the edge.
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>
      Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision.
      What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
    </b>
    <p>
      Meshes generally become smoother. Corners and edges do smoothen out too, but sometimes the particular point where the corner is remains pointy. Pre-splitting the edges intersecting the corner does minimize this! We can see this in the screenshots below:
    </p>

      Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes
      slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that
      the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your
      pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
    </b>
    <p>
      Yes, we can!! We can see in the images below that if we don't preprocess, the cube gets stretched out. We can preprocess by splitting each diagonal edge once because each square currently has an asymmetry because of the direction of the diagonal. After splitting it, each square is symmetric and we can see the beautiful results below.
